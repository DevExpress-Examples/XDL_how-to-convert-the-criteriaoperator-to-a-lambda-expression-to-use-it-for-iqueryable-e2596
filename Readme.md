# How to Convert the CriteriaOperator to a Lambda Expression to Use It for IQueryable

## Scenario

Imagine, that an end-user can build a filter criteria, e.g. by using a Filter Control, and you wish to apply this filter criteria to your IQueryable source.

## Implementation Steps

The static DevExpress.Data.Linq.Helpers.CriteriaToQueryableExtender class allows you to add extended methods for the IQueryable source, such as **AppendWhere** method. This method provides a capability to create a new IQueryable source, based upon the existing one, and add an additional **Where** condition to it. To extend the IQueryable source, add the `DevExpress.Data.Linq.Helpers` namespace in the `using` directive (or `Imports` for VB.NET).

>**NOTE**: CriteriaToQueryableExtender, ICriteriaToExpressionConverter, CriteriaToExpressionConverterInternal, CriteriaToEFExpressionConverter and related APIs from the DevExpress.Data.Linq.Helpers namespace are internal and undocumented â€“ please use them at your own risk:
>- We cannot guarantee backward compatibility and that these internal and undocumented APIs will remain unchanged in the future. We may not extend/evolve these internal and undocumented APIs.
>- We may not provide technical support for use of internal APIs â€“ you may be asked to perform your own research.
>- We also do not guarantee that this approach will operate correctly with [Criteria Language Syntax](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/4928/devexpress-data-library/criteria-language-syntax) dialects for XPO, XAF, Dashboards, and other products. If you clarify your business requirements for these products, we will be in a better position to find a more reasonable solution for you â€“ one that does not require the use of internal/undocumented APIs.
